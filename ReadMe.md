## Requirements

* Autodesk Maya 2018/2020 with Arnold
    * NOTE Arnold requires license to render simulated data without watermarks.
* [Qualoth 2020](https://www.qualoth.com/) cloth simulator. 

> To Add
* for libraries, refer to import sections that are grouped at the beginning of each .py file. All libs can be simply installed with pip.


To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
>📋  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...

* Maya 2018+ with Arnold and Qualoth
    * NOTE Arnold requires license to render simulated data without watermarks using datasim.py\datasim_runner.sh. 
    * A single-user Arnold license requires re-activation (logging-in) each time PC is rebooted
* for libraries, refer to import sections that are grouped at the beginning of each .py file. All libs can be simply installed with pip.

## Docs

* [Sewing pattern template specification](docs/template_spec_with_comments.json) - spec example with comments to all the elements.
* [Configuring dataset generation](docs/Setting_up_generator.md) - from sewing pattern template to physics simulation components
* [Running data generation](docs/Running_generation.md) - getting all the steps right.
